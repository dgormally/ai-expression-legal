      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p class="meta"><span class="app-name">AI Expression</span> · Last updated: February 15, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the <span class="app-name">AI Expression</span> mobile application ("App," "we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>AI Expression is an expression and presence coaching app. It analyzes short videos you record (e.g. for social or professional content) and provides AI-generated feedback on how you may come across to viewers—such as perceived confidence, warmth, eye contact, and related cues. The analysis is produced by third-party AI services (e.g. Google Gemini). We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any analysis.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years of age (or the minimum age required in your country to consent to use of apps and services) to use the App. If you are under 18, you should have a parent or guardian review these Terms. By using the App, you represent that you meet these requirements and have the authority to enter into these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You must not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations.</li>
      <li>Upload or analyze content that infringes others’ intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.</li>
      <li>Use the App to harass, abuse, or harm others, or to create content that is defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract the source code of the App (except where permitted by law).</li>
      <li>Use automated means (e.g. bots or scripts) to access or use the App in a way that could harm the service or other users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Certain features (e.g. the 24-hour Deep Analysis pass) may require payment. Purchases are processed by <strong>Google Play</strong> and are subject to Google Play’s terms and payment policies. All fees are in the currency and at the price shown at the time of purchase. Refunds are handled by Google in accordance with <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2479637" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play’s refund policy</a>. We do not store your payment details.</p>

    <h2>5. AI Analysis and Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App uses AI to analyze your video. You understand and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analysis is <strong>for coaching and self-improvement only</strong> and is not a substitute for professional advice (e.g. from a coach, therapist, or doctor).</li>
      <li>Results are <strong>algorithmic and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or subjective</strong>. Do not rely on them for decisions that could significantly affect you or others.</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee that the AI will perform in any particular way or that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of the videos and other content you create or upload. By using the App, you grant us and our service providers (e.g. Google) the rights necessary to process your content solely to provide the analysis and related functionality (e.g. uploading your video to the AI service). We do not use your content for advertising or to train AI models for purposes unrelated to providing the App. For more detail, see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App (including its design, text, graphics, code, and branding) is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from the App except as permitted by these Terms or applicable law. "AI Expression" and related names and logos are our trademarks.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without cause or notice. You may stop using the App at any time. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g. disclaimers, limitation of liability, governing law) will continue to apply.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP AND ANY ANALYSIS OR CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH IT ARE OFFERED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE (AND OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP OR ANY ANALYSIS OR CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH IT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (USD $100), WHICHEVER IS GREATER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES; IN SUCH CASES, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the App, your content, or any violation of these Terms or applicable law.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms in the App or at a link we provide and will indicate the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms where permitted by law. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the App.</p>

    <h2>13. General</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms (together with our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>) constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</li>
      <li><strong>No waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
      <li><strong>Governing law:</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of [Your State/Country], without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of [Your Jurisdiction].</li>
